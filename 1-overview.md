I am developing an app where users can sign in, optionally add a skill, and grant access to their location to search for services such as electronic repair, plumbing, or carpentry. It's a one-time-use app designed for users to quickly find personnel to solve daily urgent tasks such as electronic repairs, etc. The app provides targeted results based on location preferences or user-inputted location (city). Users can view a list of individuals with the required skills, including contact details (phone and email) and service costs, and click on each to see detailed skills and contact details. The primary functionality of the MVP is enabling users to sign in, optionally add a skill, and grant location access to view a feed of people with skills. Additionally, I can integrate features like favorites using data stores, depending on the time. As I continue learning, I will be able to add other functionalities such as messaging and reviews, which is why I chose this project. I'm open to suggestions for ideas and improvements in implementation.

Comments on formative submission from Nick:

I think the idea sounds very good and practical! There are a few things that might help during the development.

1. There might be several websites that provide a similar service (e.g., https://www.yell.com/s/plumbers-cardiff.html). It will be good to think about how the app can build the database of providers in the first place. It might not be realistic to ask the providers to input their information if they have already done something similar on other platforms or websites. Can the app collate provider's information from existing websites (e.g., Yell, Trustpilot), perhaps?

2. If there is a way to facilitate communication among the user and the providers, it will be much more useful. Having images/videos would be a great way for the providers to come up with a correct quote.

Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions about the feedback.`
