_Complete the information above and then write your 200 word overview below.

I am developing an app where users can sign in, optionally add a skill, and grant access to their
location to search for services such as electronic repair, plumbing, or carpentry. It's a
one-time-use app designed for users to quickly find personnel to solve daily urgent tasks such as
electronic repairs, etc. The app provides targeted results based on location preferences or
user-inputted location (city). Users can view a list of individuals with the required skills,
including contact details (phone and email) and service costs, and click on each to see detailed
skills and contact details. The primary functionality of the MVP is enabling users to sign in,
optionally add a skill, and grant location access to view a feed of people with skills.
Additionally, I can integrate features like favorites using data stores, depending on the time. As I
continue learning, I will be able to add other functionalities such as messaging and reviews, which
is why I chose this project. I'm open to suggestions for ideas and improvements in implementation.
