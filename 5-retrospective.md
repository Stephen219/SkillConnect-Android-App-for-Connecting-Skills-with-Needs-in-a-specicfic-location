Developing this app has been an insightful and rewarding journey. Overall, I achieved the core
functionality I envisioned, allowing users to sign in, view a list of service providers and their location, manage
their favorites, and adjust app settings. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the
interaction of various components of the Android API.

While developing the app, I encountered errors when setting up Room for local data storage, which
required significant troubleshooting. However, resolving these issues through tutorials and documentation deepened my understanding of
database integration in Android. I also improved my knowledge of Firebase Authentication and
Realtime Database, critical components for user authentication and real-time data synchronization in
mobile applications.

If I had more time, I would extend the app's capabilities by implementing in-app messaging and
enabling push notifications, enhancing communication and user engagement. Additionally, I would
focus on completing the feature for user reviews to provide more detailed feedback on service
providers.

To sum up this experience not only honed my technical skills but also emphasized the importance diversification in software development. If I were to develop a similar app in the
future, I would consider spending more time on initial planning and design to minimize later
refactoring since at some point i deleted some files and codes to accommodate the thought of the app.
